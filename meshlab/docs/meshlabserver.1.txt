================


NAME
----
meshlabserver - a tool for mesh inspection, processing, and conversion


SYNOPSIS
--------
meshlabserver [-i inputmesh]  [-o outputmesh]  [-s scriptfile]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extensible system for the
processing and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes. The system is
aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models
arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools for editing, cleaning,
healing, inspecting, rendering and converting this kind of meshes.
The system is based on the VCG library developed at the Visual Computing Lab
of ISTI - CNR.


OPTIONS
-------
-i inputmesh::
       The mesh file to be loaded.

-o outputmesh::
       The mesh file where to write the result.

-s script::
       The script to be applied.


There must be exactly one input mesh and at most one output mesh. Script is
optional and must be in the format saved by meshlabserver. The format of the
output mesh is guessed from the used extension.
